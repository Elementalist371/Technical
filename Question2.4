I struggled with creating a node that was linked to ubuntu but I saw that you can use key-gen and get the keys generated and use that for the credentials so that the node was active and online. Making sure I was using WSL 2, I made sure to change WSL to version 2 in
powershell so that I could use ubuntu on docker hub
